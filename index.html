               Hi, I’m Bhavya Bansal, a technology enthusiast and innovator with a deep    passion for building impactful
               solutions. My journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam
               Technical University, where I cultivated a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and
               emerging technologies.

               Early in my career, I gained invaluable hands-on experience through internships at Telaverge
               Communications and HeyDaw Technologies, where I worked on AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Swagger
               API, and other advanced technologies. These roles not only honed my technical expertise but also fueled
               my desire to create meaningful, scalable solutions.

            <p> 1. AI-Powered Facial Recognition System
                At FacesearchAI, I’ve led the development of advanced facial recognition systems, which leverage
                cutting-edge computer vision and AI technologies. These systems are designed to enhance security in
                various sectors, such as banking, retail, and public safety, offering seamless and accurate
                identification in real-time.

                2. Full Stack Web Applications
                I’ve worked on several web applications that combine front-end and back-end technologies to create
                dynamic, user-friendly platforms. These include:

                E-Commerce Solutions: Building scalable and secure online platforms that integrate payment systems,
                inventory management, and customer engagement tools.
                Real-Time Collaboration Tools: Developing web applications for seamless communication and project
                management for teams working remotely.
